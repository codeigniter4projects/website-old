            At CodeIgniter, we consider the security of our systems a top priority.<br/>

            <p>If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take

                <li>Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we will be able
                    to resolve it as quickly as possible. Complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation.
