CodeIgniter Website
###################

This is the official informational website for the 
`CodeIgniter project <https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/>`_,
rewritten using CodeIgniter4. This website replaces the 
`previous project <https://github.com/bcit-ci/codeigniter-website>`_,

The website has been open-sourced in the interest of transparency.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for contribution guidelines generally,
and LOCALIZATION.md for localization guidelines specifically


*****************
Programming Style
*****************

The website exhibits "good" programming style, although definitely not
the only way to do things. 

Some of the programming design decisions reflected:

-   The architecture adheres more to the "model-view-adapter" convention,
    where the view is unaware of the source of data and the model is unaware of
    how any data might be presented. The controllers are go-betweens.
-   A "master template" lets each controller focus 
    only with building its part of a webpage.
-   A base controller takes care of assembling finished pages, using the 
    master template.
-   Using the template parser eliminates PHP code from
    the views, where possible.
-   Mock data for the recent news and most recently active threads, means
    that the website can be tested locally, without needing access to 
    the live forum database.
-   View fragments are used to style single "records" on their own,
    improving cohesion.
-   An ".htaccess" file is incorporated, to configure Apache to remove
    index.php from any URLs.

Sitemap

The site has a simple structure ... basically two-level 
(homepage and then content pages). 
There are a couple of additional pages, for related but subordinate 
information, accessible from the footer navbar.

Appropriate comments are found in each of the controllers.
